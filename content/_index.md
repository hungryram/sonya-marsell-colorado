      Whether you are selling or buying -


      I will work tirelessly for you\! I am your trusted resource for contract
      drafting, negotiating, and market research. I utilize a team of
      professional service providers to assist my clients with buying and
      selling needs, including landscaping, painters, designers, handymen, and
      inspectors


      When I am not working, I enjoy spending time with my husband and four
      children. Two of which are adults alreadyâ€¦ Wow\! Where does the time go?
      If I am not at a sports event for my children you can find me hiking with
      friends, family and labradoodle. I love traveling to our neighboring towns
      such as Ouray, Telluride, and Pagosa Springs. I also enjoy gardening,
      television, cooking, eating out, bicycling, and having barbecues with
      friends and family.
